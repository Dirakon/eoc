["<explanation>\nMain application that continuously updates and outputs program version data. On startup, it extracts a storage path from the first argument. In an endless loop, the app retrieves the current branch and program name using external calls, logs its progress, reads the currently saved data, and fetches the latest version information. It then “actualizes” (updates) the saved data with the current version, writes the new data to persistent storage, and finally outputs the updated information as an RSS feed.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nObject for persistent program data storage. It takes a state-path and provides three functions: \n1. data-file: Constructs a file (and its parent directory) from the given state-path, branch, and program name.\n2. read: Uses the constructed file to read stored program data. If the file exists, it reads its content, splits it into lines, parses each line into a program version tuple, and returns the program data; otherwise, it returns an empty list.\n3. write: Serializes the versions from a program data instance by concatenating version number and timestamp with separators, logs the serialized string, writes it to the corresponding file, and returns the instance.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nAn object that encapsulates version data for a specific branch and program. It stores the program name and a list of version records, and provides functions to output its data as an RSS feed and update (actualize) the version list. The output-as-rss function generates XML by building a prefix with channel metadata, iterating over the versions to create individual item entries, and then printing the complete RSS content. The actualized function conditionally updates the versions, ensuring that a new version is appended only if it is not already the latest entry, while program-version creates a version record from given version number and timestamp.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nFunction \"actualized\" updates a program’s stored data with a new version. It takes a new version as input and rebuilds the program-data object (with branch and program-name preserved) by checking if the provided new version is already the last one in the versions list. If the versions list is not empty and the new version matches its last element, it leaves the list unchanged; otherwise, it appends the new version to the versions list.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nA structure that represents a program version by taking a version number and a timestamp but only returning the version number as its result.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis external object provides a collection of utilities to interact with external system commands. It defines a command separator constant for command concatenation and offers functionality to log messages (both single- and multi-line), send commands to an external system (with functions to send a command, read responses, and wait for confirmations), and handle basic file operations like reading from and writing to a file through external commands. It also includes functions to query and retrieve version information as well as branch and program name details.\n</explanation>"]
