["```\n<explanation>\nThis code defines a system to manage program versions, storing and retrieving them from the filesystem. The main object `app` takes arguments from command line and uses the first one as a path to program data called `state-path`.\n\nThe core functionality includes:\n\n- **`app`**: The main object, which takes arguments from command line (path to the state) calls external process to get new versions by program and writes output into file.\n- **`program-data-storage`**: An object responsible for reading and writing program data (versions) to files within the specified `state-path`.\n- **`program-data`**: Object representing program data i.e. branch, program name and versions that can output data in the RSS format.\n- **`program-version`**: Represents a specific version of a program, including its version number and timestamp.\n- **`external`**: An object that simulates external interactions like file reads/writes, command execution, and version retrieval.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThis object encapsulates the storage and retrieval of program data. It manages where the data is stored on the filesystem, reading the data from file, constructs the file path based on branch and program, and writing the data to a file.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nRepresents a data structure holding information about a program, including its name, branch, and a list of versions. The object provides functionality to output this information as an RSS feed and to actualize the version list by adding a new version if it's not already present.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nTakes a new version and checks if it is already the last version. If it is, it returns the existing list of versions. Otherwise, it adds the new version to the list of versions.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nRepresents a program version, storing the version number.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nContains externally facing functions. Allows you to get programs' version, the current branch, program's name and create logs. You can read from and write to files.\n</explanation>\n```"]
