["<explanation>\nPersistent service that continuously monitors and updates program version data, writing to a state file and generating an RSS feed of version history. It runs in an infinite loop that: checks current version from external source, merges with existing data from storage path (taken from first CLI argument), writes updated version list to storage, and outputs RSS-formatted results. Handles IO through external command interactions for version checking, logging, and file operations.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nManages storage and retrieval of program version data in files. Handles constructing file paths, ensuring directories exist, reading existing data (parsing version entries from \"version-number|||timestamp\" lines), writing serialized versions, and integrating with external IO operations. Acts as a persistence layer for version histories stored under a configurable state directory path.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nManages program version data and generates an RSS-formatted output. Stores branch, program name, and version history. The `output-as-rss` method constructs an RSS feed containing version history items with timestamps, while `actualized` method conditionally adds new versions to the list only if they're different from the latest existing entry. Includes XML structure generation with program-specific metadata and version entries formatted as RSS items.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nUpdates the program's data by appending a new version only if it's not already the latest entry in the version history, maintaining unique latest version while allowing historical duplicates.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nRepresents a program version with a version number and timestamp, evaluating to the version number itself.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nFacilitates external command execution and IO interactions by sending formatted requests, handling input/output, and logging. Includes methods for version/branch/program name retrieval, file read/write with structured commands (using \"|||\" separators), line counting, and response confirmation handling. Abstracts communication with an external system through stdin/stdout streams.\n</explanation>"]
