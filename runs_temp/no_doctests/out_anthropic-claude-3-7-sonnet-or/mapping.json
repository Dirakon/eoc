["<explanation>\nApplication that tracks program versions for different branches. It continuously polls for updates, reads the current saved data, checks for new versions, and then writes updated data and outputs version history in RSS format. The app takes a file path as an argument where it stores the state.\n\nThe main app loop runs indefinitely, fetching the current branch and program name through external commands, reading saved version data, retrieving the current version, updating the data if needed, and finally storing it back and outputting the version history as RSS.\n\nVersion data is stored in a file structure organized by branch and program name, with each version entry containing a version number and timestamp.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nA class that manages the storage and retrieval of program version data in the file system. It takes a state path as input and provides functionality to read and write version information for specific branch and program name combinations. \n\nThe `program-data-storage` class has the following functionality:\n- `data-file`: Creates a file reference for storing data about a specific branch and program, ensuring its parent directory exists\n- `read`: Reads version data from a file for a given branch and program, parsing stored versions if the file exists, or returning an empty list otherwise\n- `write`: Serializes program version data to a file, converting each version entry to a string format of \"version-number|||timestamp\" with each version on a new line\n\nThe class handles filesystem operations like ensuring directories exist, checking if files exist, and manages serialization/deserialization of program version data.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis function `output-as-rss` generates and outputs an RSS feed of program version history. It takes the program data (including branch, program name, and version history) and formats it into a valid RSS XML document, which is then printed to standard output. The RSS feed includes a channel with information about the program and items for each version, where each item contains the version number, a link to search for the package, and a timestamp. The function also counts and displays the number of lines in the output for debugging or monitoring purposes.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThis function `actualized` is part of the `program-data` object and is responsible for updating a version history. It takes a new version as input and returns an updated `program-data` object with the new version added to its version list, but only if needed.\n\nThe function first checks if the new version is already the last item in the versions list. It does this by comparing the index of the new version (found using `last-index-of`) with the index of the last element in the list (calculated as `versions.length.minus 1`). It also checks if the versions list is empty.\n\nIf the new version is already the last item in a non-empty versions list, the function returns the original versions list unchanged. Otherwise, it adds the new version to the list using the `with` method.\n\nThis essentially ensures that version history is only updated when a new version is detected, avoiding duplicate entries of the same version.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nA data structure representing a version of a program. It stores a version number (represented as a string) and a timestamp (represented as an integer). The version number is used as the primary identifier, accessible through the `@` attribute.\n</explanation>","<explanation>\nThe `external` object provides a way to interact with external systems. It serves as a bridge between the EO program and external commands or data sources.\n\nKey functions:\n- `line-counter`: Outputs a formatted count of lines with the format \"(lines: N)\"\n- `output-multiline`: Splits content by newlines and outputs it, prefixed with a line count\n- `log`: Logs text with a \"Log:\" prefix\n- `write`: Writes content to a file by sending an external command\n- `read`: Reads content from a file via an external command, captures metadata about lines, and constructs the content\n- `send-command`: Sends a formatted command request\n- `get-response` and `get-confirmation`: Retrieves responses from stdin\n- `version`: Gets the version of a program in a specific branch\n- `branch`: Gets the current branch\n- `program-name`: Gets the name of the program\n\nThe object acts as an abstraction layer for external I/O operations, allowing the rest of the program to interact with external systems through a consistent interface.\n</explanation>"]
