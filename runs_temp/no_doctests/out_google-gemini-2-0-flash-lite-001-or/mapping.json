["```\n<explanation>\nThe `app` object represents the main application logic. It takes command-line arguments, determines a state path, and enters a continuous loop. Inside the loop, it reads program data, gets the current version, and writes the updated data. It also includes nested functions to version, retrieve and store data, and format the output as RSS.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nAn object for storing and retrieving program data, typically versions, to and from a file system. The objects write and read functions, are the core of data persistence. It utilizes external commands for file operations.\n</explanation>\n```","<explanation>\nAn object containing program version history and related functions. The object maintains a list of program versions, each with version number and timestamp. It includes methods to actualize the version list based on a new version and output the history as an RSS feed.  The `output-as-rss` function constructs an RSS feed string from the version history and then prints it to standard output, as well as print extra debug information.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nFunction that updates the list of versions. If the new version is the same as the last recorded version, it returns versions as is, otherwise, it appends the new version to the versions list.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nRepresents a version of the program with a version number and a timestamp.\n</explanation>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThis object defines a set of external functions, delegating some actions (read, write, get version) to external system calls.\n</explanation>\n```"]
