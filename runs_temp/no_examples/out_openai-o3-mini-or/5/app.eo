# This object “external” provides a collection of utility functions for interacting with the outside world via text‐based commands, file operations, and logging. Its “@” value is set to an empty string, and it also defines a command separator (“|||”) that is used to join parts of commands. The functions can be grouped into several categories:
# • Formatting and logging functions:
# – “line-counter” takes a number (the count of lines) and outputs a formatted string showing the count.
# – “output-multiline” converts a given text into a “text-content”, splits it by newlines, then prints the line count (using “line-counter”) and echoes the original text with an extra newline.
# – “log” first prints a fixed “Log:” header, then calls “output-multiline” to display the provided text.
# • File operations:
# – “write” builds a “write-file” command (using the fixed string “write-file”) and the file’s path (via “file.as-path”), sends the command with “send-command”, outputs the content (using “output-multiline”), and then waits for a confirmation from the external source.
# – “read” creates a range of items (based on the line count that it will later parse), builds a “read-file” command (using “read-file”) concatenated with the file’s path, sends the command, reads a metadata line from stdin to obtain the number of lines, and finally reads that many lines to join them into the file content.
# • Command communication:
# – “send-command” prints a “Request:” message followed by the command string.
# – “get-response” and “get-confirmation” wait for a response by reading one line from standard input.
# • Version and identifier retrieval:
# – “version” sends a “get-version” command (using the branch and program-name given as parameters) and waits for a response that is returned as the version number.
# – “branch” and “program-name” simply send their respective fixed commands (“branch” or “program-name”) and return the received responses.
# This modular design allows other parts of the application to trigger external I/O operations (such as reading, writing, logging, or retrieving version info) by simply calling these methods.
