["<explanation>\nThis EO code defines an application “app” that continuously monitors and updates program data. The app receives command‐line arguments (with the first argument determining the “state-path”), then enters an infinite loop. In each iteration it retrieves the current branch and program name (through external commands), logs “Reading…” then uses the external interface to retrieve the currently saved data from persistent storage. It then logs “Getting current version”, obtains the current version information for the given branch and program, “actualizes” the data (updating its version history), writes the new data to storage and finally outputs the updated data as an RSS feed.\nThe code further defines a “program-data-storage” object that encapsulates file handling: generating a file path, reading (with parsing of file content into a list of “program-version” items) and writing data (serializing version information). The “program-data” object handles the representation of the application’s versions and, via its output-as-rss method, creates an RSS XML string that is printed to stdout.\nAdditionally, there is an “external” object that abstracts system I/O operations such as logging, sending commands and reading responses. Its methods simulate interactions with the underlying system for obtaining the branch, program name, version data and for file I/O.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Create a test instance of program-data with dummy branch, program name and one version.\n  [ \"test-branch\" \"test-program\" * \n      program-version\n        \"v1.0\"\n        123456789\n  ] > test-data\n  test-data.output-as-rss\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n \n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nRss:\n(lines: 15)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>test-program versions</title>\n  <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=test-branch&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=test-program</link>\n  <description>History of versions</description>\n  <item>\n    <title>v1.0</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=test-branch&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=test-program</link>\n    <description>New version at 123456789</description>\n  </item>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis object “program-data‐storage” is responsible for handling persistent storage of program data. It is parameterized by a “state-path” (a base directory) and provides three methods:\n1. data-file: Given a branch and a program name, it builds the file path where the program’s data is stored. Internally it “joins” the state-path with representations of branch and program-name (using external functions for path manipulation) and then ensures the parent directory exists (by “making” the directory) before returning the file object.\n2. read: When provided with a branch and program name, this method obtains the corresponding data file, gets its path (src), and then checks if the file exists. If the file exists, it reads its contents, splits it line‑by‑line, and parses each line into a “program version” (by scanning a formatted string). If the file does not exist, it returns an empty version list.\n3. write: Given a “program-data-instance” (which encapsulates branch, program name, and a list of version records), this method computes the data file, then “reduces” the versions into a serialized text format (each line listing the version number, a separator, and a timestamp), logs the serialized version string and writes it into the file. Finally, it returns the unchanged instance.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Instantiate program-data-storage with a dummy state-path.\n  \"dummy-state\" > dummy-path\n  dummy-path.program-data-storage > store\n\n  # Call the \"data-file\" function with branch \"test\" and program name \"demo\".\n  store.data-file > file\n    \"test\"\n    \"demo\"\n\n  # Output the result of the file location.\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    file\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n \n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\ndummy-state/test/demo\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThe documented structure defines an object named “program‐data” that represents the state of a program by bundling together a branch, a program name, and a list of version records. Its responsibilities are twofold: generating an RSS feed output from the stored versions and “actualizing” (updating) its own state with a new version.\n\nThe object takes three parameters: branch, program-name, and versions. It immediately assigns the program-name field as the object’s value. Then it defines a parameterless function “output‐as‐rss” that constructs an RSS XML string and outputs it to the standard output. Internally, it computes a “prefix” using a formatted XML header (injecting the program name and branch in the proper places) and a “suffix” that closes the channel and RSS tags. It also defines a nested function “output‐middle‐part” that iterates over the versions list and formats each version as an RSS <item> (displaying the version number and timestamp). Before outputting the XML parts, it calculates the total number of lines (using a multiplication and additions on constant numbers) and passes this count to an external line counter. Finally, the “output‐as‐rss” function outputs the entire RSS feed with proper newlines.\n\nThe structure also defines a method “actualized” that takes a new version as input. It updates the program-data. If the new version is already the last element (and the version list is not empty) it simply returns the current versions; otherwise, it appends the new version to the versions list and returns a new program-data object with the updated versions.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  [branch program-name versions] > test-data\n    \"test-branch\" > branch\n    \"test-program\" > program-name\n    *\n      [version-number timestamp] > version1\n        \"v1.0\" > version-number\n        1610000000 > timestamp\n      [version-number timestamp] > version2\n        \"v1.1\" > version-number\n        1610001000 > timestamp\n  test-data.output-as-rss\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n \n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nRss:\n(lines: 20)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>test-program versions</title>\n  <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=test-branch&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=test-program</link>\n  <description>History of versions</description>\n  <item>\n    <title>v1.0</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=test-branch&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=test-program</link>\n    <description>New version at 1610000000</description>\n  </item>\n  <item>\n    <title>v1.1</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=test-branch&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=test-program</link>\n    <description>New version at 1610001000</description>\n  </item>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis function “actualized” is a method of a program‐data object that holds three properties: branch, program-name, and versions (a list of version records). It takes a new version as its parameter and returns a new program‐data instance (by reusing the surrounding object’s factory “program-data”) with potentially updated versions. Specifically, it checks if the versions list is not empty and if the new version is already present as the last element (using list functions such as last-index-of, versions.length.minus 1 and versions.is-empty). If both conditions hold then it returns the same versions list (i.e. no change is made), otherwise it “adds” the new version at the end using versions.with. In short, this function ensures that the version history is updated only when the incoming new version is different from the latest stored one.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Test case 1: starting with one version \"v1\", call actualized with \"v1\"\n  # Expect the versions list to remain unchanged.\n  program-data > pd1\n    \"main\"\n    \"TestApp\"\n    * \"v1\"\n  pd1.actualized > updated1\n    \"v1\"\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    updated1\n\n  # Test case 2: starting with one version \"v1\", call actualized with \"v2\"\n  # Expect the new version to be appended resulting in versions [\"v1\", \"v2\"].\n  program-data > pd2\n    \"main\"\n    \"TestApp\"\n    * \"v1\"\n  pd2.actualized > updated2\n    \"v2\"\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    updated2\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n \n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nprogram-data(main, TestApp, [v1])\nprogram-data(main, TestApp, [v1, v2])\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis function, named \"program-version\", accepts two parameters: \"version-number\" and \"timestamp\".

Its “@” value is set to an empty string, and it also defines a command separator (“|||”) that is used to join parts of commands. The functions can be grouped into several categories:\n• Formatting and logging functions: \n – “line-counter” takes a number (the count of lines) and outputs a formatted string showing the count.\n – “output-multiline” converts a given text into a “text-content”, splits it by newlines, then prints the line count (using “line-counter”) and echoes the original text with an extra newline.\n – “log” first prints a fixed “Log:” header, then calls “output-multiline” to display the provided text.\n• File operations:\n – “write” builds a “write-file” command (using the fixed string “write-file”) and the file’s path (via “file.as-path”), sends the command with “send-command”, outputs the content (using “output-multiline”), and then waits for a confirmation from the external source.\n – “read” creates a range of items (based on the line count that it will later parse), builds a “read-file” command (using “read-file”) concatenated with the file’s path, sends the command, reads a metadata line from stdin to obtain the number of lines, and finally reads that many lines to join them into the file content.\n• Command communication:\n – “send-command” prints a “Request:” message followed by the command string.\n – “get-response” and “get-confirmation” wait for a response by reading one line from standard input.\n• Version and identifier retrieval:\n – “version” sends a “get-version” command (using the branch and program-name given as parameters) and waits for a response that is returned as the version number.\n – “branch” and “program-name” simply send their respective fixed commands (“branch” or “program-name”) and return the received responses.\nThis modular design allows other parts of the application to trigger external I/O operations (such as reading, writing, logging, or retrieving version info) by simply calling these methods.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  seq > @\n    *\n      # Log a multiline message.\n      external.log > @\n        \"Line1\\nLine2\"\n      # Send an external command.\n      external.send-command > @\n        \"TestCmd\"\n      # Retrieve a response from the external system.\n      response > r\n        external.get-response\n      # Print the response with a prefix.\n      QQ.io.stdout > @\n        QQ.txt.sprintf\n          \"Response: %s\\n\"\n          r\n      # Demonstrate line counting.\n      external.line-counter > @\n        3\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\nUserReply\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nLog:\n(lines: 2)\nLine1\nLine2\nRequest: TestCmd\nResponse: UserReply\n(lines: 3)\n</doctest-output>"]
