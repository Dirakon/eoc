Write a comment explaining what the object does. Only write the minimal, succinct explanation that could be inserted as a code comment above the object in place of <COMMENT-TO-BE-ADDED> mark. Do not add any additional text besides the actual comment to be added. You will be provided a few interaction examples and an actual user input afterwards.

Input:
```eo
# <COMMENT-TO-BE-ADDED>
[a b] > app
  add. > @
    a
    b
```
Output: Object that adds two numbers together.

Input:
```eo
# <COMMENT-TO-BE-ADDED>
[as-bytes] > string
  as-bytes > @

  # Get the length of it.
  [] > length /number

  # Takes a piece of a string as another string.
  [start len] > slice /string
```
Output: An abstraction of a text string, which internally is a chain of bytes.

Now follows the actual user input to be documented!
Input:
```eo
{code}
```
