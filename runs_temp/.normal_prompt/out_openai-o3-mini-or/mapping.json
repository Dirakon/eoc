["<explanation>\nThe “app” object is the main loop of a version‐monitoring application. It takes a list of arguments (where the first is used as a state or storage path) and then enters an endless loop. In each iteration it:\n• Retrieves the current branch and program name via external commands.\n• Logs that it is “Reading...” and then reads the currently saved program data from storage.\n• Logs that it is “Getting current version” and then obtains the current version (combining an external version string with the current time).\n• “Actualizes” the saved data by adding the new version if needed.\n• Logs “Writing…,” writes the updated data back to storage (serializing the version information) and finally outputs an RSS‐formatted version history.\nThis structure ties together file operations, external command interactions, logging and formatting to maintain and expose version history.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  app > @\n    *\n      \"state\"\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\nmain\nmyapp\nv1\nok\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nRequest: branch\nRequest: program-name\nLog:\n(lines: 1)\nReading...\nLog:\n(lines: 1)\nGetting current version\nRequest: get-version|||main|||myapp\nLog:\n(lines: 1)\nWriting...\nLog:\n(lines: 2)\nv1|||100\n\nRequest: write-file|||state/main/myapp\n(lines: 2)\nv1|||100\n\nRss:\n(lines: 15)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>myapp versions</title>\n  <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=main&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=myapp</link>\n  <description>History of versions</description>\n\n  <item>\n    <title>v1</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=main&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=myapp</link>\n    <description>New version at 100</description>\n  </item>\n</channel>\n\n</rss>\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis object encapsulates the persistent storage for program data. It is parameterized by a state‐path and provides three main methods. The “data-file” method computes the file (and its parent directory) that will store data for a given branch and program name by joining the state-path with those identifiers. The “read” method attempts to retrieve and parse stored program data from that file (using a newline‐delimited format where each line encodes a version and its timestamp), and falls back to an empty dataset if the file does not exist. The “write” method serializes a given program-data instance (by concatenating version numbers and timestamps with a specific separator) and writes it to the computed file while echoing the serialized data through logging.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  # Create an instance of program-data-storage with a dummy state path\n  program-data-storage > ps\n    \"/state\"\n  \n  # Retrieve the computed file object (its representation, for testing purposes, is assumed to be its path)\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    QQ.txt.sprintf\n      \"%s\"\n      *\n        ps.data-file \"master\" \"demo\"\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\n/state/master/demo\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nObject that represents the program’s version history and publishes it as an RSS feed. It takes three parameters: branch, program-name, and a list of versions. It provides two main functionalities: (1) output-as-rss, which builds and prints an RSS XML string (including a header, an item for every version in the versions list, and a footer) along with auxiliary log details such as a line count, and (2) actualized, which “updates” the program-data by either keeping the current versions list or appending a new version if appropriate.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  program-data > pd\n    \"stable\"\n    \"MyProgram\"\n    *\n      program-version > @\n        \"1.0\"\n        123456\n  pd.output-as-rss > @\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nRss:\n(lines: 15)\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?>\n<rss version=\"2.0\">\n\n<channel>\n  <title>MyProgram versions</title>\n  <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=stable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=MyProgram</link>\n  <description>History of versions</description>\n  <item>\n    <title>1.0</title>\n    <link>https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=stable&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=MyProgram</link>\n    <description>New version at 123456</description>\n  </item>\n\n</channel>\n\n</rss>\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis function (actualized) is part of the program-data object and is responsible for updating the version history. It receives a new version record as an argument and then rebuilds the program data with the same branch and program-name, but with an updated list of versions. In particular, it checks if the versions list is not empty and if the new version is already the last element (using the last-index-of and versions.length.minus operations). If so, it returns the current versions unchanged; otherwise, it appends (using versions.with) the new version to the list.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  res1 > @\n    program-data\n      \"main\"\n      \"myapp\"\n      *\n        program-version 1 100\n        program-version 2 200\n    actualized > @\n      program-version 2 200\n\n  res2 > @\n    program-data\n      \"main\"\n      \"myapp\"\n      *\n        program-version 1 100\n        program-version 2 200\n    actualized > @\n      program-version 3 300\n\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    QQ.txt.sprintf\n      \"Case1 length: %d\\nCase2 length: %d\"\n      *\n        res1.versions.length\n        res2.versions.length\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nCase1 length: 2\nCase2 length: 3\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nRepresents a program version by taking a version number and a timestamp, and returns the version number.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\n[] > doctest\n  QQ.io.stdout > @\n    QQ.txt.sprintf\n      \"%s\"\n      *\n        program-version \"v2.3\" 98765\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nv2.3\n</doctest-output>","<explanation>\nThis object named “external” provides an interface for interacting with external systems.
