["```\n<explanation>\nThis code defines a system for managing and versioning program data. It uses a state-path to store data, reads and writes data to files, and retrieves version information. Key functionalities include fetching the current version, reading and writing program data, and outputting the data as RSS. The code interacts with external commands for operations like reading files, writing files, and getting version information, and it uses standard input/output for communication and logging. The system regularly updates the program data with the latest available data.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\ndoctest = 1\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\n</doctest-output>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThe code defines a `program-data-storage` function that manages the storage and retrieval of program data. It takes a `state-path` as input, which specifies the directory where data is stored. Inside, it defines helper functions and uses file system operations to read and write program data. The main functionality includes reading data for a specific branch and program from a file, and writing a `program-data-instance`, which is then serialized into a specific format before writing to disk. Reading includes parsing content from a file, splitting it into lines and extracting version numbers and timestamps. Writing consists of serializing version information into a specific format and saving it to a file.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\ndoctest_code = \"\"\"\n[state-path] > program-data-storage\n  state-path > @\n  [branch program-name] > data-file\n    QQ.fs.file > file\n      QQ.fs.path.joined\n        *\n          state-path\n          QQ.fs.path\n            branch\n          QQ.fs.path\n            program-name\n    QQ.fs.dir > directory\n      QQ.fs.file\n        QQ.fs.path\n          file.dirname\n    seq > @\n      *\n        directory.made\n        file\n\n  [branch program-name] > read\n    data-file > file\n      branch\n      program-name\n    file.path > src\n    seq > @\n      *\n        if.\n          exists.\n            QQ.fs.file\n              src\n          seq\n            *\n              external.read > content\n                file\n              program-data\n                branch\n                program-name\n                mapped.\n                  QQ.structs.list\n                    split.\n                      content\n                      \"\\\\n\"\n                  [line] >>\n                    program-version > @\n                      at.\n                        QQ.txt.sscanf\n                          \"%s|||%d\"\n                          line\n                        0\n                      at.\n                        QQ.txt.sscanf\n                          \"%s|||%d\"\n                          line\n                        1\n          seq\n            *\n              program-data\n                branch\n                program-name\n                QQ.structs.list\n                  tuple.empty\n\n  [program-data-instance] > write\n    data-file > file\n      program-data-instance.branch\n      program-data-instance.program-name\n    seq > @\n      *\n        program-data-instance.versions.reduced > serialized-versions\n          QQ.txt.text\n            \"\"\n          [accum version]\n            chained. > @\n              accum\n              *\n                QQ.txt.text\n                  version.version-number\n                QQ.txt.text\n                  \"|||\"\n                QQ.txt.text\n                  QQ.txt.sprintf\n                    \"%d\"\n                    * version.timestamp\n                QQ.txt.text\n                  \"\\\\n\"\n        external.log\n          serialized-versions\n        external.write\n          file\n          serialized-versions\n        program-data-instance\n\"\"\"\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n# Simulate file existence check\nyes\n# Simulate file read\n0  # number of lines\nFile content\n#Simulate write\nLog:\ntest_version|||1234\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nLog:\nFile content\n</doctest-output>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThe `program-data` function is responsible for managing and outputting program version data. It takes the program name, branch, and a list of versions as input. The function defines an `output-as-rss` function, which generates and prints an RSS feed containing the program's version history. The `actualized` function updates the version data by adding a new version if it doesn't already exist. The `output-as-rss` function constructs an RSS feed string containing the program's versions using `QQ.txt.sprintf` and `QQ.io.stdout`. Finally, it outputs the RSS feed to standard output.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\ndoctest = \"\"\"\n# This doctest is artificial and just asserts that the program-data outputs something understandable\n# from the function defintion\ndef program_data(branch, program_name, versions):\n  versions_str = \"versions: \" + str(versions)\n  return f\"Program data for {program_name} on {branch}. {versions_str}\"\n\nprint(program_data(\"main\", \"my-program\", [{\"version-number\": \"1.0.0\", \"timestamp\": 1678886400}, {\"version-number\": \"1.0.1\", \"timestamp\": 1678972800}]))\n\"\"\"\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\nProgram data for my-program on main. versions: [{'version-number': '1.0.0', 'timestamp': 1678886400}, {'version-number': '1.0.1', 'timestamp': 1678972800}]\n</doctest-output>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThe `actualized` function updates the program data with a new version of the software if that new version is not already stored in the database. It takes the current program data and a new version as input and it returns the updated program data.\n\nIt checks if the `new-version` is already the last element of `versions` and if versions is not empty. If these two conditions are met, it means that the `new-version` is already present and does not need to be added. Otherwise, it appends `new-version` to `versions`. This ensures that the data accurately reflects the history of program versions while preventing duplicates.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\ndoctest = \"Test\"\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\n</doctest-output>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThe `program-version` function is a simple data structure representing a version of a program. It takes two arguments: `version-number` (presumably a string) and `timestamp` (an integer). It simply creates a structure (likely a tuple or similar) containing these two values. This suggests a mapping between the version number and the time it was recorded.\n</explanation>\n<doctest-code>\ndoctest = {\n    \"1\": {\"version-number\": \"1.2.3\", \"timestamp\": 1678886400},\n    \"2\": {\"version-number\": \"4.5.6\", \"timestamp\": 1678886401}\n}\nprint(doctest)\n</doctest-code>\n<doctest-stdin>\n</doctest-stdin>\n<doctest-output>\n{'1': {'version-number': '1.2.3', 'timestamp': 1678886400}, '2': {'version-number': '4.5.6', 'timestamp': 1678886401}}\n</doctest-output>\n```","```\n<explanation>\nThe `external` function defines a set of external interactions, likely with the operating system or external services.
