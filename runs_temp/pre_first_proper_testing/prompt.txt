# Explanation of the EO programming languge

## Overview

All the following code will be written in EO programming language. It is minimalistic functional programming language. It goes like this:

```eo
[object-arg1 object-arg2] > object
  print-hello-world > @

  print-something > print-hello-world
    "hello world"

  [function-arg] > print-something
    QQ.io.stdout > @
      function-arg
```

`@` is a special function, defining which value object evaluates to.

## Creating functions

There are 2 different ways to define a function inside an object:

1. Function with parameters
An example is the above `print-something` funtion. It takes argument, and it also defines subfunction `@`, which similarly to the class describes the result the actual function.
2. Parametrless function
If a function is parametrless, the code can be simplified and to the left of `> function-name` instead of arguments we write the first part of the ouput.

e.g. this parametrless function:
```eo
print-something > print-hello-world
  "hello world"
```

can be rewritten as this function with empty list of parameters:
```eo
[] > print-hello-world
  print-something > @ 
    "hello world"
```

## Calling functions

This is a function named `print-hello-world` that takes 0 arguments (hence empty square brackets) and calls function `print-something` with argument `"hello world"`:

```eo
[] > print-hello-world
  print-something > @ 
    "hello world"
```

If you want to pass multiple argumenets, each would take a separate line like this:
```eo
[] > print-hello-world
  print-something > @ 
    "line to print 1"
    "line to print 2"
```

If you want to pass the result of another function, you would nest the call, the indentation would decide which parameter goes to which function, like this:
```eo
[] > entry-function
  subfunction1 > @ 
    "param1 to subfunction1"
    subfunction2
      "param1 to subfunction2"
      "param2 to subfunction2"
    "param3 to subfunction1"
```

Or you can give give a name to expression like this (i.e. make it into a parametrless function):

```eo
[] > entry-function
  subfunction1 > @ 
    "param1 to subfunction1"
    saved-parameter-2
    "param3 to subfunction1"

  subfunction2 > saved-parameter-2
    "param1 to subfunction2"
    "param2 to subfunction2"
```

Note that two above code blocks give identical results when executed.

There are also arrays. `*` is a special function that creates arrays from given parameters. For example, built-in function `seq` just evaluates the array of actions sequentually like it would happen in Haskell with IO monad.

# Task explanation

You are LLM, and your goal is to create documentation for undocumented code. Your task is to write the minimal, succinct explanation that explains the structure below <STRUCTURE-BELOW-IS-TO-BE-DOCUMENTED> mark. That structure can be either class or a function.

Your answer should have three sections: explanation, doctest-code and doctest-output. Doctest should define class named specifically `doctest`, which will evaluate to some value. Doctest-output should provide the expected output of evaluated doctest.

Do not add any additional text besides the required format. You will be provided two interaction examples so that you become familiar with the format. There is no need to explain them - they are just here to show how you should answer queries. After that, you will receive the actual user input - THAT is what you should explain.

# Interaction examples DO NOT EXPLAIN THEM

Input:
```eo
# <STRUCTURE-BELOW-IS-TO-BE-DOCUMENTED>
[a b] > app
  add. > @
    a
    b
```
Output: 
```
<explanation>
Object that adds two numbers together.
</explanation>
<doctest-code>
[] > doctest
  app > @
    1
    2
</doctest-code>
<doctest-output>
3
</doctest-output>
```

Input:
```eo
# Built-in string structure, which is
# an abstraction of a text string, which internally is a chain of bytes.
[as-bytes] > string
  as-bytes > @

  # <STRUCTURE-BELOW-IS-TO-BE-DOCUMENTED>
  [] > length /number

  # Takes a piece of a string as another string.
  [start len] > slice /string
```
Output: 
```
<explanation>
Get the length of it.
</explanation>
<doctest-code>
[] > doctest
  "hello".length > @
</doctest-code>
<doctest-output>
5
</doctest-output>
```

# The actual user input to be documented THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN

Input:
```eo
{code}
```
